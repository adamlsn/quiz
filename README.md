  ## Installation
  
  No special instructions for installation, just clone repo or download zip

  ## Usage
  
  Partially unfinished, this application intends to grande a user on their ability to answer code related questions and store scores to a leaderboard. Use of web APIs is demonstrated well within this project. Some struggles with DOM manipulation, cycling over the array of questions, and setting up the localStorage leaderboard. Submitting now due to time crunch. Apologies!
